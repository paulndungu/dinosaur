                <p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.</p>

                <p>Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.</p>

                <p>Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture. The large sizes of some species has ensured their popularity in films and books.</p>

                <p>Using some of the mentioned definitions, dinosaurs can be generally described as archosaurs with hind limbs held erect beneath the body.</p>

                <p>Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Dinosaurs have always been an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500 non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. In 2016, the estimated number of dinosaur species that existed in the Mesozoic era was estimated to be 1,543-2,468. Dinosaurs inhabited every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early Jurassic period.</p>

                <p>While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton, or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. A detailed assessment of archosaur interrelations by Sterling Nesbitt confirmed or found some twelve unambiguous synapomorphies, some previously known.</p>

                <p>In the skull, a supratemporal fossa(excavation) is present in front of the supratemporal fenestra, the main opening in the rear skull roof. Radius, a lower arm bone, shorter than 80% of humerus length. Exoccipitals(bones at the back of the skull) do not meet along the midline on the floor of the endocranial cavity, the inner space of the braincase.</p>

                <p>Modern birds are known to communicate using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology.</p>

                <p>Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.</p>

                <p>Predatory theropod dinosaurs, which occupied most terrestrial carnivore niches during the Mesozoic, most often fall into the 100 to 1000 kg (220 to 2200 lb) category when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on order of magnitude. This contrasts sharply with the size of Cenozoic mammals, as about 2 to 5 kg (4.4 to 11.0 lb).</p>

                <p>The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is Giraffatitan brancai. The smallest dinosaur known is the bee hummingbird, with a length of only 5 cm (2.0 in) and mass of around 1.8 g (0.063 oz).</p>

                <p>There is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds, as well as in crocodiles(birds' closest living relatives), were also common among extinct dinosaur groups.</p>

                <p>The first potential evidence for herding or flocking as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31 Iguanodon bernissartensis, ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in Bernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole and drowned.</p>

                <p>Evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.</p>

                <p>Feathers are one of the most recognizable characteristics of modern birds, and a trait that was shared by all other dinosaur groups. Direct fossil evidence of feathers or feather-like structures has been discovered in a diverse array of species in many non-avian dinosaur groups.</p>

                <p>Archaeopteryx was the first fossil found that revealed a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds. Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds.</p>

                <p>The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had bird-like feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their skeletons, as is the case in birds. In 2008, scientists described Aerosteon riocoloradensis, the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system.</p>

                <p>Dinosaur evolution after the Triassic follows changes in vegetation and the location of continents. In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass(Pangaea), and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract.</p>

                <p>By the early Cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, iguanodontians, and brachiosaurids through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods, and rebbachisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods, also found in South America.</p>
